This Rust program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to get the modular inverse of a given integer. 
It offers functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) and determining the modular inverse where one exists.
The program performs the following steps:
1. Computes the gcd(a,b) and the coefficients of x and y so that gcd(a,b)=ax+by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
2. Determines the modular inverse if the gcd(a,b)=1.
